# ShopSavvy Price Tracker

## Introduction

This is the introduction to this new project that I'm going to be making.

🎯 PHASE 1: Foundation - "The Working Demo"  
Duration: Weeks 1-2 (35 hours)  
Goal: Build a functional product search app with authentication  
Deployable: Yes - basic but complete application  
Status: ⬜ Not Started

### What You'll Build

A working web application where users can:

- [ ] Register and log in
- [ ] Search for products across 3 retailers
- [ ] View product details
- [ ] See current prices

NO price tracking, NO wishlists, NO alerts yet - just the foundation.

## Milestone 1.1 - User Authentication (10 hours)

- [ ] User registration with email/password
- [ ] Email verification (simple, no fancy templates)
- [ ] Login with JWT tokens
- [ ] Logout functionality
- [ ] Basic profile page showing user email
- [ ] Protected routes (redirect to login if not authenticated)

## Run Locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. (Optional) Set environment variables:
   - `PORT` (default: 3000)
   - `JWT_SECRET` (default: `dev-secret`)
   - `APP_BASE_URL` (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
3. Start the server: `npm run dev`

The verification link prints to the server console in development.
