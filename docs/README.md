# 📚 Learning Resources

This folder contains educational materials and demos to help understand how the OfertaRadar Price Tracker works.

## What's Inside

### **CALLBACKS-EXPLAINED.md**
A beginner-friendly guide explaining what callbacks are with real-world analogies (like ordering pizza!) and simple code examples.

### **HOW-CALLBACKS-WORK-WITH-APIS.md**
Detailed explanation of how callbacks work with HTTPS URLs and APIs, including complete examples from this project.

### **test-api.html**
Interactive demo page to test the API endpoints and see callbacks in action. Shows real-time results when calling the APIs.

### **callbacks-demo.js**
Runnable Node.js script with 6 different callback examples you can execute to see how callbacks work.

## Why These Files Are Here

These are **learning materials** - not part of the production application. They help understand:
- How callbacks work
- Why APIs need callbacks
- How HTTPS requests use callbacks
- Real examples from the OfertaRadar project

The actual production code is in the main project folder (`/src`).

## How to Use

1. **Read the guides** to understand callbacks
2. **Run the demo script** (if you moved it here): `node docs/callbacks-demo.js`
3. **Open test-api.html** in a browser to interact with the APIs

These materials are optional - your OfertaRadar app works perfectly without them!
